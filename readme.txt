This plugin integrates Bitvolo.com trustless cryptocurrency payments (IOTA / Stellar XLM / XRP / EOS / TELOS / WAX) into WooCommerce checkout

== Description ==

If you're only accepting credit card payments, you're likely paying fees of up to 5% of your revenue. Your customers must deal with high security risks associated with online credit card payments. It is clear that cryptocurrencies provide a solution to these issues. There is a variety of ways to accept cryptocurrency payments -- most will work like credit card payment gateways: the customer sends a payment to the gateway and they make a payment to your account, with their commission deducted. Bitvolo is unique and works differently and according to the very idea of trustlessness the cryptocurrencies are base on: you don't need to trust us in the transaction, the payment goes directly from the customer to your account. 

Key features:
- Supported cryptocurrencies: IOTA, Stellar XLM, XRP, EOS, TELOS, WAX, tokens on the Stellar, EOS, WAX, TELOS networks and SEPA bank transfers
- Trustless payments: You receive payments directly to your own address â€” they never go through our accounts
- CHF 0.05 per transaction. No other fees for the seller or for the buyer
- Your prices can be expressed in any fiat currency (USD/EUR/CHF/etc). We'll automatically convert it into equivalent amount in given coin at the time of checkout
- Forget about maintenance/technical issues: We operate our own blockchain/tangle nodes and take care of the maintenance/technical issues. You should be able to operate your web shop without having to worry about such problems
